### Dance Poses Will Go Here.

This folder contains the dancer's pose sequences for each dance, stored as ```.pkl``` files.

Each file includes the reference pose sequences that will be used to compare against the player's poses during gameplay. If the file contains pose sequences for different camera angles, the comparison will be made with the sequence whose angle is closest to the player's chosen camera adjustment.

Additionally, the files include metadata such as the song name and the frame rate (FPS) of the pose sequences.
