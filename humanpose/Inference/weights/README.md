### Model Weights Will Go Here.

This folder is currently empty because the model weights are large files and should not be included in the Git repository.

#### This folder should include:
- ``vitpose-b-coco.pth`` This file is used for human pose estimation and can be downloaded from the official 
[ViTPose GitHub repository](https://github.com/ViTAE-Transformer/ViTPose).

- ```yolov8m.pt``` This file is used for human detection and should be automatically downloaded when the server starts. If the automatic download fails, you can manually download it from Ultralytics [here](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics).
